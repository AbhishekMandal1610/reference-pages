                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).</p>
                <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.</p>

                <h2>Basics and Terminology</h2>
                <p>Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).</p>
                <p>If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind the flex layout.</p>

                <p>Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Main axis: </strong> The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Main - start | Main - end: </strong> The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Main - size: </strong> A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Cross axis: </strong> The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Cross - start | Cross - end: </strong>  Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Cross - size: </strong>  The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.</p>

                            <p>The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like justify-content: space-between;) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller.

                                It is not exclusively for flexbox, gap works in grid and multi-column layout as well.</p>

                        <div class="properties">
                            <h4>order</h4>
                            <div class="image-container">

                            </div>
                            <p>By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.</p>
                            <div class="code-example">
                                <pre class="language-css"><code>.item{
    order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}</code></pre>
                            </div>

                            <p>Items with the same order revert to source order. Flex items with higher specified order values will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values. Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. So if you have four items whose order values have been set as 2, 1, 1, and 0 respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st. You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items whose value is 0.</p>

                        <div class="properties">
                            <h4>flex-grow</h4>
                            <div class="image-container">

                            <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>
                            <p>If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least). Negative numbers are invalid.</p>
                            <div class="code-example">

                            <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</p>

                            <div class="code-example">
                                <pre class="language-css"><code>.item{

                            <h4>flex-basis</h4>
                            <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.</p>

                            <div class="code-example">
                                <pre class="language-css"><code>.item{
    flex-basis: 40px | auto; /* default is auto */
}</code></pre>
                            </div>
                            <p>If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its flex-grow value.</p>

                        <div class="properties">
                            <h4>flex</h4>
                            <p>This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it’s like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.</p>

                            <div class="code-example">
                                <pre class="language-css"><code>.item{

}</code></pre>
                            </div>
                            <p>It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.</p>
